# PSP prxldr plugin for IDA

This is an updated version of prxldr for IDA v7.5 sp3.
xorloser has not actually tested this.


## Install
To install copy the files "prxldr.dll" and "prxldr64.dll" into the "IDA/loaders" directory.
If you also copy the file "psplibdoc.xml" into the "IDA/loaders" directory this plugin will use it to correctly name imports and exports.
